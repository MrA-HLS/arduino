# The Amunrud VSCode / Git / Arduino setup guide

1. You've already completed the first step: finding these instructions!
2. Find and install all of the required software (If you're using the lab, this has already been done for you)
    - Visual Studio Code from Microsoft <https://code.visualstudio.com/>
    - Git for Windows <https://git-scm.com/downloads>
    - Arduino IDE (do not use the Windows App from the store!) <https://www.arduino.cc/en/main/software>
3. Install some basic extensions for VS Code
    - C/C++
    - GitLens (optional, but very helpful for larger projects)
    - Arduino
    - Visual Studio IntelliCode / intellisense (optional again, but helpful for C/C++)
4. Configure VS Code
    1. VS Code has many ways to change settings: one of it's most powerful tools is the 'command palette.' Press "Ctrl+Shift+P" or F1 to open the command pallete.
    2. Use the command palette to select a sensible default shell:
        - start typing "teminal: select default shell" into the command pallete. It should autocomplete as you type. You can hit enter on it or click it once you see it.
        - select Git Bash from the list of available shells
    3. Start a new Terminal-we will need it soon.
    - *NB* One thing that makes VSCode so great is it's helpful suggestions and auto-configuration. As you work with the program, don't ignore it's suggestions. Read them and use them if they will help you
5. For class exercises, we will be using github.com. It's a good platform for sharing small projects.
